                    <h3>Red Fort, Delhi</h3>
                    <p class="desc-text">
                        The Red Fort, which is also known as the Lal Qila, was constructed by one of the most famous Mughal emperors, Shah Jahan. 
                        Built on the banks of river Yamuna, the fortress-palace was designed by architect Ustad Ahmad Lahauri. 
                        It took 8 years and 10 months to build the magnificent fort. 
                        The fort served as the royal residence of the Mughal emperors from 1648 to 1857.
                        Built with red sandstones, the fort is almost impregnable.
                        In modern times, the fort is of importance to the people of India as the Indian Prime Minister delivers his Independence Day
                        speech from the fort, every year on August 15. In 2007, it was declared as UNESCO World Heritage Site.

                    <h3>India Gate, Delhi</h3>
                    <p class="desc-text">
                        India Gate is a war memorial built to commemorate the British India Army who lost their lives during 
                        World War I and the Third Anglo-Afghan War of 1919. India Gate, which is located at the eastern 
                        end of the Rajpath (formerly called the Kingsway), is about 138 feet (42 metres) in height.
                        On the rooftop above the archway is a broad shallow domed bowl that was intended to be filled with flaming oil on ceremonial occasions. 
                        No fires have been set on the rooftop in recent years, but four eternal flames are now sheltered at the base of the structure. 
                        The flames demarcate the Amar Jawan Jyoti, a small monument that has served as India's tomb of the unknown soldier since 1971.
                        The names of individual Indian soldiers—more than 13,000 of them, according to the Commonwealth War Graves Commission—are
                        inscribed in smaller letters on the monument.

                    <h3>Jallianwala Bagh, Amritsar</h3>
                    <p class="desc-text">
                        Located in close proximity to the Golden Temple in Amritsar, it was here on 13th April, 1919 that 
                        the British troops opened fire on a large group of unarmed protestors. This incident marks the pages of history as
                        the Amritsar Massacre. To escape the bullets, many people jumped into the well while many lost their lives in the ensuring stampede. 
                        This incident also proved to be a turning point in the history of India's independence struggle.
                        It stands as a symbol of struggle and sacrifice and continues to instill patriotism amongst the youth. In March 2019, 
                        the Yaad-e-Jallian Museum was inaugurated showcasing an authentic account of the massacre.

                        The Taj Mahal of Agra dates back to the 17th century. It represents the pinnacle of grand Mughal 
                        architecture and is built entirely of white marble. 
                        Shah Jahan built this magnificent monument for one of his favorite wife, Mumtaz Mahal. 
                        In its harmonious proportions and its fluid incorporation of decorative elements, the Taj Mahal is distinguished as the 
                        finest example of Mughal architecture, a blend of Indian, Persian, and Islamic styles.

                        lovely gardens, and a museum. It took around 22 years to complete the construction of this splendid monument and
